                    Technology is basically skills , methods or processes to achieve certain goals . In the 21st century technology plays a very vital role in different aspects like education, health, entertainment, defence, agriculture, business etc .However technology has its own advantages and disadvantages over us .The one of the best advantage of technology is that  it helps us to get more exposure and helps connect with more people all across the world in our daily lives . Nowadays technology is the way of learning in the modern world . Without the Internet it is becoming harder and harder to live . It has made the process of learning more interactive and more interesting . Nowadays it is very easy to find materials and resources on the internet . Besides these platforms like youtube have also encouraged us to be more independent and teaches us about self paced learning  Different Social media like facebook etc helps us to get daily news and updates of world in a daily basis as well as it helps us in a communication with our friends , families and others in this difficult situation ..Recently the technology has helped us so much. Because of the current situation of COVID most of us are in lockdown . Many businesses have been shut and almost all the regular operations that used to be running like banks, hotels, restaurants, schools are closed. But softwares like google meet, zoom microsoft teams etc makes it easier to run the official and educational operation in this difficult situation too . Schools can operate through this softwares which allows the interactive interaction between teachers and students which makes it closer to the real life school / college and university environment . Offices and Companies are also able to work from home due to the internet as well as government operations are also able to run through these online interactive video calls.

                    Although it has so many advantages, it has some critical disadvantages as well . We have to be dependent upon the electricity and our ISP while doing some very important and critical work . As I mentioned schools have been operating online , they are also taking exams online so it may be some problem who does have electricity or internet problems. We have to sit upon computers and mobiles all the time which we have spent upon the physical activities which can lead to mental fatigue and mental issues as well .Social media and mobile devices may lead to psychological and physical issues, such as eyestrain and difficulty focusing on important tasks . There is also a very high risk of losing our important data and personal details online as we are fully dependent upon the internet to do many kinds of work .People who are not used to this can easily be scammed and fooled. Another disadvantage can be that it can cause us many physical damages . Working on a computer all the time can lead to bad posture of the body as well as it is very harmful for the eyes of an individual .It also reduces our physical activity , so our body cant remain fit.
